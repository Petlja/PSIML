    "### Goal\n",
    "In this workshop you will build a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch. You will use datasets and dataloaders to manipulate the data. You will learn how to make new models or change existing ones. You will make a 'training loop' to train, validate and test your model. \n",

    "You have already learned how to make PyTorch datasets and dataloaders in previous workshop, so this time we will use some pre-made ones to speed things up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head out to [torchvision/datasets](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html) and check out the [Fashion-MNIST](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#fashion-mnist) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 'map style' dataset, therefore, `dataset[idx]` will return a sample at that index in form of a tuple (image, label) similar to the dataset example you saw in the PyTorch lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that only train and test parts of the dataset are available. Therefore, we need to split the training part into train and validation. For this purpose it is useful to check the [SubsetRandomSampler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.SubsetRandomSampler). Then, we will provide the train and valid split indices to create the corresponding samplers that we will pass to the train and valid dataloaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you wish to add some augmentations to your training dataset, you will need to create separate datasets. In the cell below, we create only the dummy transformations to convert our data into tensors. If you wish to play with data augmentations check [torchvision.transforms](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/transforms.html), however, it is optional and you can complete the workshop without any augmentations."
